# Chapter 3: Linear Regression 
---

This chapter is about linear regression, a very simple, yet powerful, approach to supervised learning for predicting a quantitative respone. In this chapter, we review some key ideas underlying the linear regression model, as well as the <strong>least squares</strong> approach, that is commonly used to <strong>fit</strong> a model
