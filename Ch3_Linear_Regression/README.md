# Chapter 3: Linear Regression 
---

This chapter is about linear regression, a very simple, yet powerful, approach to supervised learning for predicting a quantitative respone. In this chapter, we review some key ideas underlying the linear regression model, as well as the <strong>least squares</strong> approach, that is commonly used to <strong>fit</strong> a model. 

## 3.1 Simple Linear Regression 
SLR lives up to its name: it's a straightforward approach for predicting a response <strong>$Y$</strong> on the basis of a <strong>single</strong> predictor $X$. We assume there is approximately a linear relationship between the two. Mathematically it's written as: <br>
 $$
\begin{equation}
  Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1X
\label{eq:SLR}
\tag{3.1}
\end{equation}
$$
"$\approx$" is read as approximately. We can also
