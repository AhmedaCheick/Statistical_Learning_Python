    "This chapter is about linear regression, a very simple, yet powerful, approach to supervised learning for predicting a quantitative respone. In this chapter, we review some key ideas underlying the linear regression model, as well as the <strong>least squares</strong> approach, that is commonly used to <strong>fit</strong> a model. \n",

    "SLR lives up to its name: it's a straightforward approach for predicting a response <strong>$Y$</strong> on the basis of a <strong>single</strong> predictor $X$. We assume there is approximately a linear relationship between the two. Mathematically it's written as: <br>\n",
